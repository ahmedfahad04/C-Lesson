In Observer pattern we have subject and observer. Now tell me two points
1. is there any benefit if we use reference of subject in concrete subject instead of extending the subject class?
2. is there any benefit of using observer class as Interface instead of abstract class?

Sure, here are the answers to your questions:

1. Yes, there is a benefit of using a reference of the subject in the concrete 
subject instead of extending the subject class. By using a reference of the subject, 
the concrete subject can implement multiple interfaces or extend other classes as 
needed, without being limited to a single inheritance hierarchy. This provides 
greater flexibility and allows for more modular and reusable code.

2. Yes, there is a benefit of using the observer class as an interface instead of an 
abstract class. By using an interface, we can achieve greater flexibility and avoid 
the restrictions of a single inheritance hierarchy. An interface allows for multiple 
inheritance, which is not possible with an abstract class. Additionally, using an 
interface promotes loose coupling between the subject and observer, which can make the 
code more maintainable and easier to modify.
