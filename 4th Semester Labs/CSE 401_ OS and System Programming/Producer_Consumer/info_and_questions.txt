The bounded-buffer problems (aka the producer-consumer problem) 
is a classic example of concurrent access to a shared resource.
A bounded buffer lets multiple producers and multiple consumers 
share a single buffer. Producers write data to the buffer and 
consumers read data from the buffer.

In this deirectory I tried to focus on different cases sequentially where
I'd need to use semaphores to solve the problems arose on those steps.

Questions:
1. What if I use sleep in both producer and consumer while having semaphroes?
2. What if I use sleep in both producer and consumer while not having semaphroes?
3. What if I removed the mutex and just use semaphores?
4. What if I use sleep in both producer and consumer while having semaphroes and not having mutex?
